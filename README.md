# Tunic Decrypt Helper

It is a simple tool to help me decipher the writing in tunic. currently the manual and all writing of the game is decrypted. but I refuse to see guides. I want to solve it by myself and this tool is intended for that purpose. Start using the information on page 21 and 54. Make sure you have them before using the tool.

# using 

install python and the requeriments.txt and execute main.py
